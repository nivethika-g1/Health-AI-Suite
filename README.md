## 🩺 HealthAI Suite – Intelligent Patient Care System

An end-to-end Healthcare AI system integrating Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP for intelligent patient risk assessment, clinical decision support, and multilingual communication.

## 📌 Project Objective

✅HealthAI Suite is designed to simulate a real-world healthcare intelligence system that:

✅Predicts disease risk from patient vitals
  
✅Estimates hospital Length of Stay (LOS)
     
✅Analyzes clinical notes
    
✅Detects patient sentiment
   
✅Translates medical instructions
     
✅Supports both staff and patient roles
   
✅Offers API access and deployment-ready infrastructure
